# Three JS AI Auto Steering

I LOVE ***mathematics*** and ***programming***, so I decided to create a project based on both of them.


Auto steering for relastic models wander behaviour[^1][^2] with [Three.JS](https://threejs.org "Three JS Official website") library that uses [WebGL API](https://www.khronos.org/api/webgl). This artificial intelligence depends on *mathematics*, *geometry*, and some *algorithms*.
